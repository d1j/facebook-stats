# "Cha Cha" reaction counting script

The script analyzes basic stats of a Facebook chat.

It gathers the following information:

* The number of messages each participant has sent;

The script also figures out how many times each participant reacted to a particular participant's message in the group chat.

Calculated data is written to a *.csv file.
